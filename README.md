# Username
Username was originally inspired by the [userrecon](https://github.com/thelinuxchoice/userrecon) shell script. I saw much potential and felt it can do much more if written in python. This is just the beginning of a detailed project. 

Currently right now it simply tells you if a username exists and where it exists. With the exception of finding a username on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/onlytechmeout/). Then it will tell you the persons name as well by using web scraping.

## Requirements

	[Python3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/)
	[Beutiful Soup 4 or higher](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

## Usuage
	Navigate to the username directory on your computer in your terminal and type the following. 

	`python3 username.py`
